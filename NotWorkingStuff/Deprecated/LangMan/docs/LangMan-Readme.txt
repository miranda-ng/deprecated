Requirements
----------------------
	-> Miranda IM 0.6+:
	Miranda IM is needed in version 0.6 or greater.

Usage
----------------------
	The Language Packs can be managed here:
	'Options' -> 'Customize' -> 'Language'

	When you do a right-click on a specific language pack, you are able to
	uninstall that file if it is no longer needed. 

Installation
----------------------
	Find 'miranda32.exe' on your computer.

	Just copy all the contents of the zip-file as they are into the 'Plugins'
	subdirectory in the Miranda IM folder.
	'Language Pack Manager' will detect the files and move them into the appropriate
	directories on it's first run.
	
	You can also do all the installation by hand, if you want to:

	Main Plugin: Copy the file 'langman.dll' into the 'Plugins' subdirectory
	in the Miranda IM folder. 

	The Unicode version of the plugin will only work on Windows NT/2000/XP,
	Windows Server 2000, Windows Vista or later with an installed
	Unicode version of Miranda IM.
	To use it on Windows 95/98/Me, please download the ANSI version of the plugin.
	  
	Documentation: The txt-files should be moved along with the SDK-zip into the
	'Docs' directory in the Miranda IM folder. 

	That's it!
