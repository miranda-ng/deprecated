/*! \mainpage MetaContacts plugin
 * \image html ulp.gif
 * \section desc Description
 * This library is a plugin for Miranda IM.\n
 * It allows the user to group several contacts from different
 * protocols (such as AIM or ICQ) into one unique metacontact.\n
 *
 * \section principle How does it work ?
 * Only one protocol will be used at a time (the default protocol).\n
 * This protocol is referenced in the proper field of the MetaContact
 * section in the Database.
 * 
 * \subsection send Emission of messages
 * The plugin will search through the Database to get the default protocol
 * (i.e. the protocol used to communicate with),\n and then call the Send function 
 * provided by this protocol.
 *
 * \subsection recv Reception of messages
 * When a contact is converted to a metacontact, or when it is added to an existing
 * metacontact, it gets a pseudo protocol \n (named "MetaContacts") in the protocol chain.\n
 * Usually, when a message is received, all the protocols in the chain get this message,
 * the real protocol (for example ICQ) at the end.\n But here, the message will be intercepted
 * by the MetaContact protocol, which will inhibit the further reception.\n The message will
 * then be redirected to the MetaContact, that will display it normally.
 *
 * \subsection handling Handling MetaContacts
 * There are four functionnality for handling MetaContacts :
 * \li Convert a contact to a MetaContact.
 * \li Add a contact to an existing MetaContact.
 * \li Edit a MetaContact.
 * \li Delete a MetaContact.
 *
 * They all are accessible via the context-menu displayed when a right click has occured,
 * but not at the same time : The 2 first will appear when the menu concerns a simple contact.\n
 * whereas the 2 last are only accessible from a MetaContact.\n
 * Those functions are self-explanatory, and a MessageBox is shown before any modification, so, for
 * further information, take a look at the Dialogs shown when they are called.\n
 *
 * \section cvats Caveats
 * Several functionnalities have not yet been developped :
 * \li Assigning contacts by Drag'n'Drop
 * \li Updating dynamically the status of the MetaContact
 * \li Merging history of all the contacts attached to MetaContact
 * \li Handling Files and URLs as well as Messages
 * \li and some other little functionnalities...
 *
 * Some of those functionnalities will not be developped due to the architecture
 * of Miranda (the 2 first, for example)
 * 
 * \section mail Contact
 * For any comment, suggestion or question, send a mail to shaalj@free.fr.\n
 * This code is provided as-is, and I cannot be held responsible for any harm
 * done to your database by this plugin.\n
 * Test it first on a fake database before using it normally.
