Opening
--------

Chess4Net is a program for playing chess via Internet. It can be used as a standalone application (Socket version for Microsoft Windows or Linux) or as plug-in for such instant messengers as Skype, Miranda, QIP Infium, Trillian Pro and &RQ. Two modes of chess game are supported: standart chess and its random counterpart - PP Random Chess. Chess4Net supports sudden death and incremental time controls as well as possibility to give your opponent a time-handicap. If you want to improve your chess skills there is also a support for a training mode. You can also invite other contacts to watch the games you're playing in real-time.

Middle game
------------

Installation:

Socket version:
  Extract the archive to desired folder on your computer.

Skype plug-in:
  * Windows:
  There're two options. You can either install from installation package or download an archive and extract it to a desired folder on your computer (Windows version).

  * Linux:
  Extract downloaded archive to a folder. If you're root then make the user to have full access to the installation folder.

Miranda plug-in:
  Extract archive to the Miranda Plugins directory and re/start Miranda.

QIP Infium plug-in:
  Extract archive to the QIP Infium Plugins directory and re/start QIP Infium

Trillian Pro plug-in:
  Extract archive to the Trillian plugins directory; go to Trillian->Trillian Preferences... choose Plugins and check Chess4Net_trillian.dll box.

&RQ plug-in:
  Extract archive folder Plugins\ to the installation directory of &RQ (the one where &RQ.exe is located).

How to use:

Socket version:
  1) Start Chess4Net.exe
  2) Choose 'Connect...'
  3) Type in-your name into 'Your Nick' edit-box.
    a) Choose Server; provide your partner with IP (type 'ipconfig' in Start->Run... or command line to find it out in Windows; run ./get_ip.pl from installation in terminal on Linux); enter Port# (agree upon it with your partner).
    b) Choose Client; Enter IP or domain Name that your partner told you; Enter Port# (for each instance of Chess4Net it should be unique).
  4) Click OK and wait until the connection is completed.

Skype:
  * Windows:
  1) Run Chess4Net_Skype.exe. If you don't have Skype running it will start automatically. Click 'Allow access' when dialog 'Chess4Net_Skype.exe wants to use Skype' pops-up.
  2) When a window with Skype contacts appears choose a contact you want to play chess with.
  3) Wait until connection is completed.
  
  * Linux
  1) You should have Skype running and be logged in to it.
  2) In terminal go to the installation folder for example:
    cd ~/Chess4Net_Skype
  3) Run Chess4Net:
    ./Chess4Net_Skype

Miranda:
  1) Right-click the contact you want to play chess with and select 'Chess4Net' from contact pop-up menu.
  2) Wait until connection is completed.

QIP Infium:
  1) Open a chat window for the contact you want to play chess with.
  2) Press 'Chess4Net' message button (below the upper frame on the right where the incomming and outgoing messages are shown).

Trillian Pro:
  1) Right-click the contact you want to play chess with and select 'Chess4Net' from pop-up menu or open message window for that contact and type "/CHESS4NET" without double quotes.
  2) Wait until connection is completed.
  NB: Chess4Net uses instant messages to transmit moves and other information. In Trillian Pro there is no way to suppress messages unlike in Miranda, so 
you may want to switch off the sounds for incomming messages while playing.

&RQ:
  1) Open a chat window for the contact you want to play chess with.
  2) Press 'Chess4Net' chat button (below the upper frame where the incomming and outgoing messages are shown).
  3) Wait until connection is completed.

Chess4Net uses context-menu so if you find yourself in trouble don't hesitate and press the right button of your mouse.
After several runs in installation folder (socket, Skype) or \Chess4Net folder (messengers other than Skype) you will find Chess4Net_GAMELOG.txt with all games you have played with Chess4Net so far, user data base (Chess4Net.pos and Chess4Net.mov) and external data bases (other files *.pos and *.mov) which are used in training mode.

Training mode:

The training mode can be switched on/off in Game Options menu. The user data base and external data bases are used in training mode only. The User DB will contain all games played by the user in the training mode, and data from it is used to provide prioritized move hints.
User DB can learn from your games in order to give you best choices. You can also select an external DB to use together with user DB to improve the quality of move hints.

Game transmitting mode:

While you're playing some games you can invite other contacts to follow up these games in real-time. Therefore you must

Miranda:
  start a new session of Chess4Net for a contact you want the game(s) be transmitted to. A mode selection dialog appears asking if game broadcasting has to be started. You must select 'Yes' (if you select 'No' an ordinary game session is created). After that you should select a game for transmition (only if there're several games in progress).

Skype:
  select Broadcast... from pop-up menu. A list of contacts appears. Select a contact whom you want to transmit the game played to.
  
After your contact connects he/she'll be able to watch the game.
