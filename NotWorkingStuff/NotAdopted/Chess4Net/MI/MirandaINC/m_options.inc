        Notes  : Strings in the structure can be released as soon as the
                 service returns -- but icons must be kept around, this iss
                 not a problem if you're loading theem from a resource.
                 -
                 This service should only be called within the ME_OPT_INITIALISE
                 event hook.

                 Pages in the options dialog operate just like pages in property
                 sheets, See the WinAPI documentation for details on how they operate.
        Version: Prior to v0.1.2.1 the options dialog would resize
                 to fit the largest page, but since then it's a fixed size
                 The largest page that fits neatly is 314x240 DLU's
                 -
                 Some of OPTIONSDIALOGPAGE's fields are version dependant.
