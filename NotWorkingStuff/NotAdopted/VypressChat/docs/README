1. WHAT IS IT
=================================
1.1. Features
	TODO

1.2. Requirements
	TODO

1.3. Limitations

3. COMPILING FROM SOURCE
=================================
3.1. Requirements
	You will need a mingw/cygwin instalation with basic unix
	tools (like ls, rm) and gcc, make, binutils. Maybe something else.
	Just try to compile and watch for errors :)

3.2. Gow to build it
	TODO

3.3. Anonymous access to CVS repository
	TODO

4. CODING
=================================
4.1. Code layout
	Tabs are 8 chars and max code line length is 100 chars.

4.2. Charset stuff
	Everything inside plugins' structs and between the calls is done
	in utf-8, sans some exceptions (strings from/to network and Windows).
	
	Strings that are sent to network should first be reprocessed
	by util_utf2vqp(), to translate them to fitting encoding for the
	receiving host. The same is with incoming network strings
	- use util_vqp2utf().

	Use 'W Win32 calls to send/recv unicode strings within Win32 API.
	util_utf2ucs() and util_ucs2uni() routines are provided for
	conversion from/to wchar_t * to char * and back.

4.3. Basic source overview
	TODO

4.4. Vypress Chat/quickChat protocol
	TODO

5. FAQ
