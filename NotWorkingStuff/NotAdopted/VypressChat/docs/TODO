=====================
- bug: sometimes topic is shown as ... in vypress chat.
- bug: (QC: 3. If netcard has more the one ip-addresses (e.g. for EmLan
	protocol on terminal server), incoming message is duplicated so much
	time, how many additional ip-addresses are determined :).)

	; i guess, no, we'll have to provide an adapter list in configuration dialog
	for the user to select which interface he would like to bind to...
