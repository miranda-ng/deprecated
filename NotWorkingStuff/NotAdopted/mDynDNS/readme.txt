mDynDNS: Description
This is a plugin for people who has connection with dynamic IP and uses
Dynamic DNS Host Level Service on http://dyndns.org

DynDNS is a cost free service to bind a Domain (e.g. miranda.dyndns.org)
to an unstatic IP adress. 
So for example if you want to set up a home server, but your Internet
Service Provider does not provide you with a permanent IP adress,
how can possible users make use of your server?
You can send your users your current IP adress erverytime it changes or you
can bind your IP adress to a dynamic Domain.
This plugin submits your current IP adress to the server of the DynDNS service.
So the server can always synchronize your dyn. Domain to your current IP.
