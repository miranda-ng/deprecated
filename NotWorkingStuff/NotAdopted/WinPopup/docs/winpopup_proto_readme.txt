VikPoup, RealPopup, Netter and Miranda`s net_send_protocol, mNetSend plugins.

Notes:

	Search supports wildcards (case insensitive):
		?      - any single symbol,
		*      - any number of symbols including zero,
		#      - any digital symbol,
		[abcd] - symbol set,
		[a-z]  - sumbol range,
		[!...] - NOT in symbol set or range.

	How to send group messages:
		1) Open plugin options page;
		2) Check "Use Mailslot when sending" option;
		3) Press "Add Contact..." button;

		in plugin options.
		
	"Legacy online status detection" option:
		Detection online status by <00> NetBIOS-name also,
		normally status detected by <03> NetBIOS-name (aka Messenger).
