[Database encryption mode]

[Standard]

[Total]

[Only critical data are encrypted (passwords, security tokens, etc). All other settings and history remains unencrypted. Fast and effective, suitable for the most cases]

[All string settings and all events in histories are encrypted. It also makes Miranda much slower and creates a risk of losing everything you've stored in a database in case of losing password. Recommended only for paranoid users]
